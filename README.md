#Arkanoid Game in Java
This project is a Java implementation of the classic Arkanoid game. It uses the biuoop library for graphical user interface (GUI) handling and animations. The game consists of several levels that the player can progress through by breaking bricks with a ball controlled by a paddle.

Features
Multiple Levels: The game includes several predefined levels that can be selected by command-line arguments or defaults.
Smooth Animations: The game is rendered with smooth animations running at 60 frames per second.
Sprites and Game Flow: Various game objects (such as bricks, balls, and paddles) are represented as sprites, and the game flow is managed by a dedicated GameFlow class.
Keyboard Input: The game detects and reacts to keyboard input, allowing players to control the paddle.
